# ultrasound-imaging

As an overview, this project was completed as a group as the final course project for BME 386, Medical Imaging. The scope of the project is a simple ultrasound imaging device that uses an ultrasonic sensor to distinguish between 3 hand gestures; rock, paper and scissors. To capture a high quality image, the sensor was translated in the x and y planes using a mechanical pulley system.
